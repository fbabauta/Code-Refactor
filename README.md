In the internet world, we are all aware that web accessibility and consistency is extremely important for our viewers. To make life easier for both, people and machines to read and understand,  I eliminated all default tags (div and span tags) and utilized semantic html tags (header, article, figure and section tags), attached a title to the webpage, and assigned alt attributes according to their correct images so that the information and images are accessible to the visually impaired. It is important to remember to keep an html file semantic friendly, and the proper elements must be logically structured. .

The navigation links are grouped efficiently, the main content of the website is structured in sections of three. For the classes, I used common names of classes rather than using the content specific names. Doing this would allow others a better concept on a logically structured webpage.  *Comments are added in a short description pertaining each semantic tag and its purpose.*

As a final observation, I was able to amalgamate the original CSS stylesheet as I found it lengthy and inconsistent.  I kept all global rules and the smaller ones that include the specific rules needed for those sections; eliminated any rules that appeared monotonous.
